## Zhao et. al. - SL-vessels

This repository contains the code for two vessel counting tools. For instructions on how to use them, please look into the README of the respective tool:
- Vessel Wizard (Standalone counting software): Subfolder VesselWizard
- Macro for ImageJ/Fiji: Subfolder FijiMacro

These tools can only support the researcher with the tedious task of counting xylem vessels, not automate it. They should not and cannot be used as automatic counting tools. The results always need to be manually checked to include false negatives and exlude false positives.
